# Creekwatchers

Android app for the Wicomico Creekwatchers organization.

Creekwatcher volunteers visit creek sites around Salisbury and survey their conditions, such as weather, water temperature and depth, and wind speed. 

Volunteers will use the Creekwatchers app to input these conditions at their site and submit their survey to the Creekwatchers organization.
